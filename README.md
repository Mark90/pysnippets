# PySnippets

This repository will be an archive to any Python snippets I write.
The purpose of these scripts vary; sometimes I want to learn about a pypi package or a module from the standard library.
I also want to get used to benchmarking solutions by profiling execution times or memory usage.
Other purposes are to prototype ideas I have, or document how I got certain things done. I might start writing a blog about these things one day when I feel I have valuable information to share.

I intend to write everything crossplatform targeting interpreter version 3.x.
